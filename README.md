### <ins>__Overview and Origin__ 

* **Company Name:** 
    * KuCoin
<p>

* **Incorporated:**
    * 2017<sup>1
<p>

* **Founders:**  
    * Michael Gan, Eric Don, Top Lan, Kent Li, John Lee, Jack Zhu, and Linda Lin.<sup>1
<p>

* **How did the idea for the company come about?** 
    * KuCoin was formed in 2017 with the idea in mind to become 'The People's Exchange.' The founders and CEO's believe that *everyone* will become involved in crypto to some degree and their vision is to create an exchange that facilitates that idea.<sup>2
<p>

* **How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?** 
    * Kucoin received $20M in investments from 4 primary investors in 2018. Those Investors include *NEO Global Capital, Matrix Partners, Kamika Yashwant,* & *IDG Capital.*<sup>3
<p>

## Business Activities:

* **What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**
     * KuCoin is seeking to make itself one of the most dynamic ways that investors, hobbyists, speculators, and more can have access to cryptocurrencies. This means offering a variety of financial tools as well as games, information, and over 250+ currencies and tokens on their platform. The 'problem' in theory would be general accessibility both in the pockets and minds of people as blockchain and crypto technologies & usage continue to grow exponentially.<sup>5
<p>

* **Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**
    * As it says in their marketing tagline, KuCoin seeks to be *"The People's Exchange*"- meaning that everyone in the world at any given time is an intended KuCoin customer. As of August 30th, 2021 the company boasts 8 million users.<sup>4
<p>

* **What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**
    * KuCoin offers over and above most of it's competitors the number of tokens available for trading through its platform and a number of investment tools. With over 250 tokens and several different algorithmic trading bots, staking, and lending services (for both borrowers and lenders), KuCoin stands apart from several of it's competitors in this way.<sup>5
<p>

* **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)** 
    * KuCoin is using algorithmic trading to offer 'bots' to their customers which seek to take advantage of market volatility while allowing users to 'set it and forget it.' They are also taking advantage of other corners of crypto tech including GameFi, Meme tokens, NFT's, and games-of-chance. <sup>2</sup>
     * KuCoin also offers a robust API which allows programmers and interested parties to interact with the exchange and it's data through channels other than it's own main GUI. This includes API access to its "Sandbox" feature wherein users are provided the opportunity to test their trading ideas without having to actually risk real capital.<sup>5</sup>
     * KuCoin offers margin trading as well which opens up the opportunity for investors to borow low interest capital in order to invest in long and short positions. This is automatically managed by the exchange so that lenders are at absolute minimal risk.
<p>

## Landscape:

## Results

* **What has been the business impact of this company so far?**
    * KuCoin has risen quickly among its competitors in the crypto-exchange world and seeks to breech the Top 50 in marketshare by Q4 2021. Forbes listed KuCoin as one of its best crypto exchanges of 2021<sup>6</sup> and at the time of this writing (9/28/2021) KuCoin is listed as the 4th ranked Crypto exchange on CoinMarketCap (CMC).<sup>7
<p>

## Recommendations

* **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**
    * Kucoins already colorful and engaging GUI would be a unique place to host a digital art NFT exchange wherein users could browse galleries and purchase/auction/sell those NFT's directly on the exchange. 
    * KuCoin currently offers many ways to engage in community on its exchange platform, however there is a sense that there could be more ways to draw users to open and engage with the app. Forming a sense of society through in-app direct messaging and commenting (e.g. WeBull), more advanced profile creation, gaming, etc..etc.. could bring in new and more casual users. I believe there is a marketshare of crypto-adjacent users out there who could be more interested in playing solitaire in some crypto-related way that would then act as a gateway to getting them comfortable with the exchange and its other offerings.
<p>

* **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**
    * I believe that this aligns really with KuCoin's vision of becoming the real "People's Exchange." KuCoin in many ways stands out to my eye as something that can lend itself to capturing more of the 'beginner' and crypto-adjacent markets however seems more focused on things like ICO's and other adoptions. Granted these are important angles for the company to approach too in a growing crypto economy however as someone who likes to engage in conversation with the average person in my community about crypto it seems apparent that there are other ways to build points of entry for those prospective customers.
    <p>

* **What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**
    * Kucoin would use its already existing app, blockchain, and KCS token to incentivize participation in both the NFT marketplace and the more social/point-of-entry aspects of its service.
    * Separately KuCoin could take advantage of its already very accessible and open API to encourage the creation of apps for its deployment of both my suggestions; the NFT market place particularly but also some kind of gaming, social, and/or community platforms could stand alone as apps available to download apart from the main gui.
    <p>

* **Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**
    * The first point about the NFT marketplace is already well baked in to the app as it stands now. As KuCoin App uses sub accounts to organize the different aspects of trading on its platform it would not necessarily be reinventing the wheel in order to create a space specifically for digital art & NFTs.
    * Similarly since KuCoin's API is so relatively vast in its offerings and accessible it is not a far cry from existing technology to put more resources behind motivating app designers to even make their own apps uaing that API and/or create something of that nature that coule be integrated into the app itself. For example, creating a way for users to import or easily connect to other social media channels and then rewarding the most popular ones assuming that they are actively creating traffic on the KuCoins network.
